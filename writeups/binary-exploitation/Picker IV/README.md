## The Challenge

![Challenge Description](Images/1.png)

We're given the program's soruce code and a binary file for the code. we will inspect those files and see what we can do.

## Solution

### Step 1

By looking at the source code we can see that the program excepts an input that will be an address in hex. we also can see that there is a "win" method which should give us the key. now we have to find the address for the programm so it will "jump" to the "win" address.

### Step 2

Now we will look into the binary file. we will open it using Ghidra. Then we will look at which address the Win function is stored at.

As we can see the address for "Win" method is stored at 0040129e, we will copy that value into the Challanges instance.
