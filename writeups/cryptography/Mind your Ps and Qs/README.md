## How to solve it
Based on the description and the known cipher, we can conclude that this is RSA encryption.

C = ciphertext
p and q = prime numbers
n = p * q
phi = (p-1) * (q-1)
e = some number that 1 < e < phi and gcd(e,phi) == 1 
d = e^(-1) mod phi

now we need to find p and q.

The hint "Bits are expensive, I used only a little bit over 100 to save money" indicates that the number n is
relatively small (just over 100 bits). This means factoring it into prime factors is achievable using automated
tools, which is why we used the FactorDB website. Since the number is relatively small, it can be quickly
factored to find the prime factors p and q This allows us to compute the private key and decrypt the message.
Therefore, we will input N into the FactorDB website to obtain p and q.

Now we will write some code to calculate the private key (d) and decrypt the message:

the challenge is solved.
