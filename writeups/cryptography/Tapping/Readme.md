##  Challenge Description

**Category:** Cryptography  
**Difficulty:** Medium  
**Name:** Tapping  
**Author:** Danny

> There's tapping coming in from the wires. What's it saying?

**Server:** `jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org 48247`

##  Requirements Before Starting

- You need Python installed on your system.
- Internet connection is required to connect to the remote server.
- Morse code decoding will be needed â€” use: (https://www.dcode.fr/morse-code)

##  Solution Steps

###  Step 1: Connect to the challenge server

I wrote a simple Python script to simulate `nc` (netcat) since it's not available in Windows PowerShell by default.
