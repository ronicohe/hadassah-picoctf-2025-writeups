# Solution
The file looks like its base64 encoded, so we decodec it.
the result:
b"b'd3BqdkpBTXtqaGx6aHlfazNqeTl3YTNrXzg5MGsyMzc5fQ=='\n"
Westripped and decoded again:
b'wpjvJAM{jhlzhy_k3jy9wa3k_890k2379}'
# Ceasar decryprion
here we can see that it looks like the flag. We know part of the plaintext which is thw beginning of the flag "picoCTF{".
From here we can deduce that we have a shift of 7 letters. We use a python script and decode:

the flag : picoCTF{caesar_d3cr9pt3d_890d2379}
