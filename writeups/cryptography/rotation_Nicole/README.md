# This is the encrypted flag I received: xqkwKBN{z0bib1wv_l3kzgxb3l_555957n3}

# The name of the challenge is rotation - so I guess I need to try to make rotation to get the original flag. Use Caesar cipher encryption.

# I used the Python code I attached here.

# I have attached the output of the code.

# I saw in the output that on the eighth rotation I got the flag.
